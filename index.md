Welcome! The purpose of this website is to host my Data Science related projects for your viewing pleasure, all of which are readily available on the 'Projects' page.

On the other hand, if you would like to find out a little more about yours truly, simply head on over to the 'About' page.

Finally, feel free to reach out with me via my e-mail or through LinkedIn to discuss Data Science, Data Engineering, coding, or anything in-between!
