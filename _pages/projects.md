## Spotify Top 200 Daily Tracks & Features Analysis [(Project Link)](https://github.com/ryanhfrench/portfolio/tree/master/spotify_analytics_dashboard)

Probably my most used app on a daily basis, my Spotify is almost always open whether it be me creating playlists to share with my friends, listening to a podcast on the way to class, or enjoying my Discover Weekly while I code. Due to its position as one of the largest streaming platforms in the world, I was interested to take a look at the daily updated Top 200 RSS Feed (which can be found at https://spotifycharts.com/regional/global/daily/) and see if I could create a database to house the data as well as a dashboard to effectively explore it.

## Analyzing The Gaming Industry Over Time [(Project Link)](https://github.com/ryanhfrench/portfolio/tree/master/digitizing_the_gaming_industry)

As an avid gamer when I discovered the Video Game Sales dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings) I was excited to see what different forms of visualizations I could create. In regards to the overall presentation, I wanted to embrace the culture of video games from a stylistic point of view and opted for a retro-themed color scheme and image style.

## Visualizing, Predicting, & Understanding Crime in Syracuse [(Project Link)](https://github.com/ryanhfrench/portfolio/tree/master/visualizing_predicting_understanding_crime_in_syracuse)

As the culmination of my Undergraduate career in at Syracuse University's School of Information Science and the Ren√©e Crown Honors Program, I was interested in pursuing a Capstone project that both would allow me to demonstrate my Data Science skillset and also contribute to the local community. It is with this goal in mind that I set out to visualize, predict, and understand the nature of crime in the city of Syracuse with the goal of providing new insights to the Syracuse population.
