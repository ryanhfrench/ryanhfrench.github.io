## Spotify Analytics Dashboard
Music is one of my favorite indulgences and I usually spend hours a day on
Spotify listening to my favorite playlists. As such, I was interested in
utilizing the data available from Spotify to create an end-to-end system which
would read in the daily data from the Spotify Top 200 songs, query their
relevant audio features, create a SQL database and import said data into it,
and finally, provide a Tableau dashboard with which to conduct analysis.

## Digitizing the Gaming Industry (Information Visualization)
A life long video game fan, I found that video game sales made for a great
dataset to fully explore my data visualization skills. Although the many
individual plots generated can be viewed in the R code, the full aesthetic
effect is best captured via the poster which was made through Adobe Illustrator.

## Visualizing, Predicting, & Understanding Crime in Syracuse (Undergraduate Honors Capstone)
For my Undergraduate Honors Capstone I was interested in not only tackling a
problem that would not only allow me to demonstrate and expand upon my data
science skillset but that also would allow me to contribute to the Syracuse
community as well. Through the course of visualizing the data, building
prediction models, and synthesizing the results in a way that was meaningful,
I was able to achieve the previously mentioned goals and practice demonstrating
data science outcomes to both the expert and layperson alike.

## Analyzing Key Indicators of Positive Reviews for iOS Apps (Scripting for Data Analysis)
Recently the first company to reach 1 trillion dollars in valuation, Apple has
undoubtedly cemented itself as the tech giant of our time. With one of the most
profitable (and closely regulated) app stores in the world, I was interested to
see whether or not I could build a predictive model capable of classifying
highly rated apps.

## Analyzing Key Indicators of Kickstarter Project Success (Data Analytics)
The largest crowdsourcing company on earth, Kickstarter has long been examined
as an example of "kick-starting" ideas and business done right. Over the course
of this project I look at a variety of different attributes for each project
with the goal of predicting which projects will ultimately result in successful
fundings.

## Airline Customer Satisfaction Analysis (Introduction to Data Science)
Like many industries, airline companies are constantly attempting to draw in
new customers and maintain the loyalty of their present clientele. Through
surveying current fliers, they can endeavor towards improving their experience
and offering the services desired. Determining what these services are is the
key deliverable of this project.
