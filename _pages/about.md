From what you eat for breakfast, to the route you take to work, to your internet browsing history, data is everywhere around us. As such, the understanding and manipulation of data provides endless opportunities to reconcile inefficiencies, understand correlations, and improve the world around us.

Having spent my undergraduate career studying Information Management & Technology at Syracuse University, I am familiar with the practice of manipulating information, or unfiltered data, in a variety of formats. However, my desire to further my learning and my love for coding lead me to enroll in Syracuse’s Fast Track program for Applied Data Science.

In my pursuit of a Master’s degree in Applied Data Science, I look forward to gaining a better understanding of data as it relates to modeling our world, interesting and innovative ways to utilize said data, and discussing the ethics of data creation and consumption to create models based in morality.

As said by renowned data scientist Cathy O’Neil, “Data Science doesn’t just predict the future, it causes it” and I look forward to playing my part in the process!
