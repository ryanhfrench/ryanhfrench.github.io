## Digitizing the Gaming Industry (Information Visualization)
A life long video game fan, I found that video game sales made for a great
dataset to fully explore my data visualization skills. Although the many
individual plots generated can be viewed in the R code, the full aesthetic
effect is best captured via the poster which was made through Adobe Illustrator.
